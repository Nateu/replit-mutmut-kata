# Mutmut kata

This kata is created by me to learn more about combining unit testing and mutation testing to enhance TDD learnings.

Basic idea of TDD is that we do as little as possible as we wirte our test (RED), write the code (GREEN) and refactor; but at any given time we should not introduce code that isn't strictly needed.
This gave me the idea of using mutation testing to double check that we didn't introduce code that is not tested.  

## Replit issue with python repls
When you get errors on virtualenv or setuptools run this:

```
pip install -U virtualenv setuptools
```

### Why I use Makefiles
